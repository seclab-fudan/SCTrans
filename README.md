# SCTrans
Welcome to the SCTrans repository, which provides tools and scripts supporting our paper **"SCTrans: Constructing a Large Public Scenario Dataset for Simulation Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems"** accepted at ICSE24. Visit our [website](https://seclab-fudan.github.io/SCTrans/) for more information and **dataset access**(See Section Open Source Protocol).

### Quickstart
- **Source Code:**
  - Explore the `scenario-runner/` directory for modified versions of Lgsvl & Carla scenario runners.
  - The `transformation/` directory contains all code necessary for scenario transformations.
- **Docker Container:**
  - **Download:** Access the Docker container [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NReqsgsbG_gj-j89GF_2wx6hB4u_NRSJ/view?usp=share_link) to streamline setup and usage.
  - **Instructions:** Detailed guidelines on using the Docker container are available in the artifact readme, accessible [here](https://github.com/seclab-fudan/SCTrans/blob/main/ICSE_Artifact_Readme.pdf).
- [**Note**] Weâ€™ve transitioned away from the VM as the Docker setup is designed to be sufficient.

### How to Contribute
We value your contributions to improve SCTrans. Hereâ€™s how you can help:
- **Code Contributions:** Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
- **Issue Reporting:** If you encounter issues or have suggestions, please submit them as issues on GitHub.


### File Contents
