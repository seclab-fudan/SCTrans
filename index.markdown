## Research Problem

Due to the cost and risk of deploying autonomous driving systems (ADS) in the real world, simulation testing has become an important complementary technique for the safety assessment of ADS. In essence, simulation testing is a scenario-driven approach, whose effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of given simulation scenarios. Moreover, simulation scenarios should be encoded into well-formatted files, otherwise, ADS simulation platforms cannot take them as inputs. Without large public datasets of simulation scenario files, both industry and academic applications of ADS simulation testing are hindered.

To fill the gap, we propose a transformation-based approach **SCTrans** to construct simulation scenario files, utilizing existing traffic scenario datasets (i.e., naturalistic movement of road users recorded on public roads) as data sources. Specifically, we try to transform existing traffic scenario recording files into simulation scenario files that are compatible with the most advanced ADS simulation platforms, and this task is formalized as a Model Transformation Problem. Following this idea, we implement an automated tool called SCTrans and construct a dataset of over 1,900 diverse simulation scenarios.

Both [source code](#source-code) and [dataset](#dataset) of SCTrans are public, please see our [sharing policy](#open-source-protocol) for more details.

## Approach Overview

To address the aforementioned issue, we propose to achieve a format transformation, i.e., to transform traffic scenario recording files into simulation scenario files while preserving the scenario semantics. To ensure the correctness of this format conversion, we formalize this task as a Model Transformation Problem.

Specifically, we begin by creating <strong>Meta-Models</strong> for both traffic scenario recording files and simulation scenario files, referred to as the <strong>source Meta-Model</strong> and <strong>target Meta-Model</strong> respectively. These <strong>Meta-Models</strong> outline the abstract syntax of the respective languages, encompassing elements, structures, attributes, and their constraints.

Once we meticulously establish the precise mappings between the elements and attributes of the <strong>source Meta-Model</strong> and the <strong>target Meta-Model</strong>, we proceed to formulate concrete <strong>transformation rules</strong>. These rules enable the automated conversion of a traffic scenario recording file into a simulation scenario file.

Our approach is denoted as SCTrans.

## Dataset

To evaluate the prototype of SCTrans, we selected random traffic scenario recording files from representative traffic scenario datasets: CommonRoad<sup><a href="#reference">[1]</a></sup>, inD<sup><a href="#reference">[2]</a></sup>, and highD<sup><a href="#reference">[3]</a></sup>. This resulted in a collection of 1,994 simulation scenario files. The breakdown is as follows: 994 from CommonRoad, 500 from inD, and another 500 from highD. These scenarios were built on 406 different maps and are compatible with advanced simulation platforms like LGSVL<sup><a href="#reference">[4]</a></sup>+Apollo<sup><a href="#reference">[5]</a></sup> and Carla<sup><a href="#reference">[6]</a></sup>+Autoware<sup><a href="#reference">[7]</a></sup>.

Each output includes two description files (VSE Scenario and OpenScenario), four map description files (Apollo HD Map, Autoware Vector Map, OpenDrive, and Lanelet2), and a map assets file (LGSVL AssetBundle). Additionally, we provide scenario players for two simulators.

We intend to release this comprehensive dataset, containing all curated scenario files generated by SCTrans. To access this dataset, please follow our sharing protocol.

Please note that according to our policy, we cannot provide access to the source traffic scenarios directly. If you wish to access these source traffic scenarios, kindly refer to the provided reference<sup><a href="#reference">[8,9,10]</a></sup> and adhere to the specified requirements.

## Source Code

We are also in the process of releasing the complete source code for all SCTrans modules. This includes SCTrans itself, the scenario runner for two simulators, and any other modified code. For access to the source code, please refer to our GitHub repository at [SCTrans](https://github.com/seclab-fudan/SCTrans). If you find the repository useful, please consider citing our paper and give this repository a **Star**ðŸŒŸ.
